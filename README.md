### Hi, I'm Laïla 👋

I'm a Software Engineer, based in Paris, France with a profound interest in pedagogy and culture.

**About me**

- My MBTI profile is sometimes [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/fr/la-personnalite-infp) or [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/fr/la-personnalite-infj) for what it's worth 🤷‍♀️ 
- Amongst all my previous experiences, I always been very product-oriented. I need to understand the usage of the final user to develop properly 🤔 
- I'm really passionate about refactoring and leaving the campground cleaner than I found it 🏕️
- I tend to speed on things when I'm nervous and I could definitely get better at front-end and unit testing 🤕
- I'm a Tech Coach for students of [Ada Tech School](https://adatechschool.fr/) since January 2023, also a content writer for Ada since summer 2024 🧑‍🎓
